Assignment uses Power BI and ArcGIS to create visualisations using maps <br/>

Overall Theme of Assignment: <br/>
Assume that you are an analyst researching on air travel across the world, and you are tasked to use Power BI to create visualisations using maps. <br/><br/>

Dataset for the following questions. <br/><br/>

3. For this question, refer to the following URL on using ArcGIS:<br/>
  a. In planning for sporting events in London, spatial analysis for the sports fans is conducted. The following are some of the planned events: Wembley for football, Twickenham for rugby and Wimbledon for tennis. Which airport is the closest? Create a visualisation with pins as shown below. <br/>
  b. The sports fans may want to visit nearby castles after the sports events. The castle locations are found in https://suitcasesandsandcastles.com/castles-in-london/. The fans are staying at Best Western Mornington Hotel at Lancaster Gate. Are all the castles listed within 30 mins drive away from the hotel? Create a visualisation with a highlighted zone of accessibility within 30 mins.
<br/><br/>

4. The fans may also drive out into the countryside to visit more castles. The locations are found in https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/familydaysout/top-10-family-days-out/. However, it can be very dangerous to drive in unfamiliar routes, leading to potential accidents. Road accidents data is found under the “Areas and Authorities” sections in https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/reported-road-accidents-vehicles-and-casualties-tables-for-great-britain.,br/>
  a. Create a visualisation of the locations of the castles in the countryside.
